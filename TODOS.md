# TODOS

# Tests
1. Random tests
2. Fault tolerance tests
3. Benchmark tests
    - To measure effectiveness of algorithms
    - Percentage of faulty network
    - Corrupted data
    - Throughput? Number of RPCs? Timing?
4. Checks

# Implement algorithms from paper
1. Congestion algorithms
2. Better peer discovery
    - Request more peers if current peers do not own all chunks
# Add fault tolerance
1. RPC unreliability
2. Peer crashes
# Add dynamic peer addition
1. See if RPCs can send
